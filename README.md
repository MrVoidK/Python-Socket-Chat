Simple Python Socket Chat Application
This repository contains a basic client-server chat application built using Python's socket module. It is designed as an introductory example for socket programming and demonstrates fundamental concepts like establishing connections, message passing, and multi-threading for handling multiple clients.

Features
#Client-Server Communication: Enables text-based communication between a single server and multiple clients.
#Multi-Threading: Allows the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
#Message Protocol: Includes a header-based protocol for message length and a disconnect command (!DISCONNECT) to end the communication.
#Customizable: Easily extendable to add more functionalities, such as encryption or a GUI interface.

File Descriptions:
Server:
-Listens for incoming client connections.
-Handles each client on a separate thread using Python's threading module.
-Receives and processes messages sent by clients.
Client:
-Connects to the server using the provided IP address and port.
-Sends messages to the server and prints the server's responses.

Notes:
-Ensure the client and server are on the same network if using a local IP address.
-You can modify the PORT and HEADER values as needed for your application.

Potential Improvements:
-Add encryption for secure message transmission.
-Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced usability.
-Extend the server to handle message broadcasting to all connected clients.
